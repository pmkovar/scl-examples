=============================

Software Collections (SCL) are RPM-based technology that give you power
to build, install, and use multiple versions of software on the same system,
without affecting system-wide installed packages.

This repository includes set of RPM SPEC files that follow the best practices
for creating Software Collections.

This repo currently includes:
  * foo/ -- SCL providing a CLI application and a daemon
  * bar/ -- SCL extending foo1 collection and providing CLI application that uses
  foo collection
